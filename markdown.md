* Jordan Walke is credited with creating React.JS 
    - While working at facebook

* React was created inside Facebook's Ads Organization
    - predecessor being [XHP](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/xhp-a-new-way-to-write-php/294003943919/) (PHP framework)
* Created to improve speed of writing code, managing a huge codebase, and prevent cross site scripting

* React's state is immuablty so that somewhere deep in that app, the views change case a conflict in the state.(a Cascading Update) (provide example)

* React started out being used for the like and comment section of Facebook

* React became open source, out of a need to decouple itself from the Facebook site and 
be able to let instagram use the framework as well. (finished at JS Conf 2013)
